# Task: Memory Optimization Function
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Human Attempt (Partially Incorrect Idea)
# At first, I attempted to manually convert numerical data types to save memory. My idea was to check each column type and directly convert float64 to float32 and int64 to int32.
def optimize_memory(cleaned_dt):
for col in cleaned_dt.columns:
if cleaned_dt[col].dtype == 'float64':
cleaned_dt[col] = cleaned_dt[col].astype('float32')
elif cleaned_dt[col].dtype == 'int64':
cleaned_dt[col] = cleaned_dt[col].astype('int32')
return cleaned_dt
# Issues with My Approach:

# No Memory Comparison: I didn‚Äôt measure memory usage before and after optimization.
# Missed object Columns: Some categorical columns stored as object could be converted to category for further optimization.
# No Safety Checks: Some conversions could have caused data loss if not handled properly.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Corrected Version (ChatGPT Assistance)
# I asked AI for a better version that also calculates memory usage before and after optimization.

# üîπ Prompt Used:
# "Improve my memory optimization function for Pandas DataFrame. Ensure it prints memory usage reduction and converts object columns to category."
